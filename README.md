# tactical_game_with_deep_RL
A turn-based strategy against an AI powered by deep reinforcement learning

What it is:
The main body of code (C#) represents a turn-based strategy in the style of Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics where the player controls a set of characters on a tiled board to defeat an opposing set of characters. The opposing characters are controlled by a deep learning ai (Python) hosted on a RESTful api.

Features:
* AI powered by deep Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning with deep neural networks
* GUI with intuitive controls for ease of play
* Extensible object-oriented design
* Seamless C#/Python integration

Where it's going:
* Online training regimen for AI to adapt in near real time
* Campaign of multiple scenarios with increasing difficulty
* Integration of character progression system
